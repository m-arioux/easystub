# easystub
A simple REST API configurable with a web application

:warning: __THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS__ :warning:

The goal of this project is to have a highly configurable Node.JS Express REST API. You can define in a web application what are the routes you want to define and what these routes should return.

In other words, this project is to help people making isolated manual tests on JSON APIs. If you develop an app that consumes another API and you want to test some very precise corner-cases without bothering the other team, just stub them!

This will all be containerized into one single Docker image for ease of use.

## The stack
API built with NodeJS & Express

Web app built with Blazor (new to me, this is the first project I'm doing with this tech)
